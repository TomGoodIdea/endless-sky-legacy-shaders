# Legacy Shaders for Endless Sky

This Endless Sky plugin allows running the game on systems limited to OpenGL 2. It provides a shader set based on [vanilla Endless Sky shaders](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/tree/master/shaders), slightly modified to be compatible with older GLSL versions. Keep in mind that the shader part of OpenGL 2 support in Endless Sky is _unofficial_, so please report any crashes, glitches, and game startup problems on this plugin's [issues page](https://github.com/TomGoodIdea/endless-sky-legacy-shaders/issues).
